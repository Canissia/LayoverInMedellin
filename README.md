Things to do while in Medellin

This project uses google maps API. The app is centered on Medellin, Colombia. I lived in Medellin for 3 years and I absolutely loved every second. I commonly hear tourists ask for the most enjoyable activities for their visit. This is my forever project as I hope to scale to show my appreciation for this beautiful city.

My goal was to create a map with some tourist must visit places that are pinged with different icons.

The toughest part of this project was billing and API key. I made an array of objects that houses the name, location, and icon information. The eventListener work onclick to display the name of the business. There is also need for a ‘For’ loop to display each object correctly. 

I made a secondary page in my website to house this internet dependent app by linking it to the home page with a return button.

I look forward to scaling this project to include reviews and photos.
